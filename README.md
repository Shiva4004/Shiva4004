## 👋 About Me

I’m **Shiva Yadav**, a **17-year-old developer from India** with a deep interest in **operating systems, binary execution, and low-level software design**.

My journey started with application and web development, but over time I found myself drawn toward the layers *beneath* frameworks — loaders, memory layouts, ABIs, executable formats, and the mechanics of how a program actually becomes a running process.

Today, my focus is firmly on **systems-level engineering** and **learning by building from first principles**.

---

## 🧠 Current Focus

Right now, most of my time is spent exploring:

* ⚙️ **Operating system internals**
* 🪟➡️🐧 **Running Windows binaries on Linux**
* 📦 Executable formats (PE, ELF)
* 🧩 Relocations, loaders, and startup routines
* 🔬 ABI behavior and calling conventions
* 🛠️ Writing small, explicit, debuggable systems code

I enjoy working close to the boundary where **software meets the operating system**.

## 🚀 Flagship Work

### **QVZ Linux Subsystem for Windows (QVZ-LSW)**

An **independent, research-driven systems project** that explores running **Windows PE executables on Linux** by re-implementing the Windows loader and execution model from scratch.

The project focuses on understanding:

* How Windows executables are loaded
* How relocations actually work in practice
* Where Windows and Linux execution models differ
* What really happens before `main()` is ever called

This project is about **understanding**, not abstraction or convenience.

---

## 🔍 Technical Interests

* Low-level systems programming (C, low-level C++)
* OS loaders and memory management
* Cross-platform execution models
* Binary analysis and reverse engineering (for learning)
* Debugging complex, undocumented behaviors

I’m especially interested in areas where **documentation ends and experimentation begins**.

---

## 🧰 Background

Before focusing on systems work, I built experience across the software stack:

* 🌐 Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* 🖥️ Backend: Node.js, PHP, Python
* 🗄️ Databases: MySQL, MongoDB, MariaDB, MSSQL
* 🐧 Linux servers: Nginx configuration and deployment
* 📱 Mobile development: Android (Java, Kotlin)
* 🎮 Game engines: Unity & Unreal Engine (exploration)

This background helps me reason about systems **end-to-end**, from user interfaces down to execution internals.

---

## 🧭 Philosophy

* **Learn by building** — theory sticks when it’s implemented
* **Understand before abstracting**
* **Correctness over shortcuts**
* **Small, readable code over large frameworks**
* Curiosity beats credentials

---

## 🌍 Beyond Code

I enjoy thinking about:

* How operating systems evolve
* Why design trade-offs exist in real systems
* How constraints shape good engineering

I believe strong engineers are formed by **curiosity, patience, and persistence**, not just tools.
